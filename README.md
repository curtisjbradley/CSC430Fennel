## About

This is a project for CSC430. We created and updated a programming languaguge named QWJZ throughout the quarter. The purpose of this project is to recreate QWJZ5 in Fennel.

## How to Run

Make sure to have both Lua and Fennel installed. You can go here https://fennel-lang.org/setup. If you have homebrew, you can just run:

```
brew install fennel
brew install lua
```

Afterwards, when you want to run the code in assignment.fnl, run:

```
lua run.lua
```
